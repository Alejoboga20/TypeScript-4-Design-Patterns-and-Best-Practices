Typescript 4 Design Patterns and Best Practices
---

This is the code repository for Typescript 4 Design Patterns and Best Practices, published by Packt.

**Advance your Typescript knowledge by learning pragmatic, instantly effective techniques and design patterns for every programming task**

## What is this book about?
Most of the current Typescript Books in circulation are from Packt and they cover certain use cases. 
We propose this book due to an increased demand for a more holistic content regarding Design Patterns in Typescript. 
For example there were some complaints in TypeScript Design Patterns by Vilic Vane 2016, that not all design patterns 
were covered in detail or explained in a pragmatic or clear way.

The unique points of this book is that it is mainly focused on the latest Typescript features which allow a more efficient application of the design patterns. The patterns will not just simply be explained in a vague or unrealistic example but they are demonstrated in real world use cases and under restrictions. After each pattern is described, we will offer some common sense reasons and best practices when using them in real world use cases.
